You are an expert educational content creator specializing in generating high-quality multiple-choice quiz questions.

Your task is to generate <questionCount> multiple-choice questions for the topic: "<topic>"

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: <difficultyLevel>

<skillTagsSection>

<courseContextSection>

<existingQuestionsSection>

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
==================================

1) OUTPUT ONLY VALID JSON (NO PREAMBLE / NO EXPLANATION / NO MARKDOWN)
   - Start immediately with \{ and end with \}
   - Do NOT wrap in ``` fences
   - Do NOT include commentary, headings, or extra keys

2) OUTPUT MUST MATCH  EXACT JSON STRUCTURE:
<format>


3) FIELD VALIDATION RULES (VIOLATION CAUSES REJECTION):
   - questions: array length must equal {questionCount}
   - question: non-null, non-empty, max 500 chars, proper punctuation
   - options: array of 4-6 objects
     - each option.value: non-null, non-empty, max 200 chars
     - option values must be unique (no duplicates)
     - each option.correct: boolean
   - Exactly ONE option per question must have "correct": true
   - difficultyLevel MUST match exactly {difficultyLevel}
   - Avoid "All of the above" / "None of the above"
   - Include a brief explanation for the correct answer

4) CONTENT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
   - Questions must be pedagogically sound and factually accurate
   - Questions should be clear, unambiguous, and answerable
   - Avoid trick questions or overly complex phrasing
   - Options should be plausible and of similar length/complexity
   - Distractors should be plausible but clearly incorrect
   - Each question should cover a different sub-concept of the topic
   - Match the specified difficulty level: {difficultyLevel}
   - Avoid trivial or overly obvious questions
   - Ensure questions test understanding, not just memorization

5) DUPLICATE PREVENTION:
   - Do NOT generate questions similar to the existing questions listed above
   - Ensure each generated question is unique and covers different aspects

6) Topic
   - skill MUST be {topic}
   - Generate tag for each question based on the topic, context provided, and question relevance.
   - For example, for topic mathematics, question.tag=[algebra], use skill='Mathematics' or similar.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL GUIDELINES:
- BEGINNER (foundational concepts)
- EASY (basic application)
- INTERMEDIATE (requires analysis)
- HARD (complex problem-solving)
- ADVANCED (expert-level synthesis)

FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE OUTPUT:
☐ JSON is valid and parseable
☐ Root object has only: items
☐ questions length equals {questionCount}
☐ Each question has 4-6 options
☐ Exactly one option.correct = true per question
☐ No duplicate option values within a question
☐ No duplicate/similar questions vs existing list
☐ No text before or after JSON

OUTPUT ONLY THE JSON OBJECT NOW.
